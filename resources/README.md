# Resources Folder

The `resources` folder in a GitHub repository is typically used to store various types of files that are needed for the project. These files can include:

- Images: Any images or graphics that are used in the project can be stored in the `resources` folder. This can include icons, logos, or any other visual assets.

- Documentation: If there are any documentation files related to the project, such as user manuals or technical specifications, they can be stored in the `resources` folder.

- Configuration Files: Configuration files, such as JSON or XML files, that are used to configure the project can be stored in the `resources` folder.

- Sample Data: If the project requires sample data for testing or demonstration purposes, it can be stored in the `resources` folder.

By organizing these types of files in a dedicated `resources` folder, it becomes easier for developers and contributors to locate and manage these files. It also helps to keep the repository structure clean and organized.

Remember to include a `README.md` file in the `resources` folder to provide instructions or additional information about the files stored within it.
